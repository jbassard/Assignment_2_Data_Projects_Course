Assignment 2 Data Projects Course from Coursera

This is the second project assignment for the Developping Data Products course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track. **The purpose of this project is to create an interactive plot with plotly R package.** I will create an interactive plot with the data of the artisanal companies in France (numbers, sales revenue, net added value) per department. Original Data is downloaded from data.gouv.fr.

Data are visualizable here: http://rpubs.com/jbassard/298977
